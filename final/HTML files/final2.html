	<div class="solid"><h5>In the car community people turn their ordinary car into a race machine or even a show car. Car enthusiast usually would spend from $500-$100,000 on the journey to building their dream car. It's hobby and a gamble. So next time you see any customized car or loud car just know it has some money invested into it.</h5></div>

		<h7 class="Engine"> - The engine of a car is the most important part of a car so people would typically rebuild their engines with better and stronger parts for more power outage and reliablilty.<br/> <br/>

		- The drivetrain consists of the transmission and driveshaft of the cars. These changes can improve responsiveness and handling of the cars. (clutch, flywheel, LSD, driveshaft, transmission mount) <br/> <br/>

		- The brakes are essential when having a powerful and fast car because you will need the braking power to stop the car. (brake pads, rotors, brake lines, calipers) <br/> <br/>

		- The exhaust is crucial for letting out the car's back pressure and releasing it in the most efficent way out the car. The more power, the more back pressure, which means better/bigger air flow exhaust. (downpipes, test pipes, exahaust)  <br/> <br/>

		- The exterior parts of the car is mostly for weight reduction, aerodynamics and looks. (carbon fiber, wheels, lights)  <br/> <br/>

		- Intakes are mostly to help the cars breath in fresh cold air.  <br/> <br/>

		- Interior parts are for looks and weight reduction. (racing seats, gauges, shift knobs, steering wheel)  <br/> <br/>

		- The suspension of a car is important for better handling and the cars rigidity, allowing it to take corners at higher speeds without understeer or oversteer.(coilovers, frame brace, springs)  <br/> <br/>
