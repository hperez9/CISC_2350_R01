1)  Take the CISC_3300_MoveButterfly_FrameMethod_rot and  CISC_3300_MoveButterfly_FrameMethod for translation and rotation of a 
    butterfly with alternating content and
        a) Split the screen in half and on the right hand side, translate then rotate the container ( increment 20 pixels for translate, 5 degrees for rotate)
           on left hand side of screen rotate then translate the container
        b) Have the two containers move toward each other until they touch each other, then move away from each other ( horizontally)

2) Given the HTML file below, write a script file which 
             A)     - Searches for all occurences of a word in each paragraph within the div section using querySelectorAll to place the paragraphs into an array and
                       search each paragraph individually for a word
                       Alias the button click button to the function which performs the searches for the applicable paragraphs.

                   - For each paragraph element in the array of paragraphs, searches for a word which is input on the HTML page via the textbox or a span tab, 
                      and if it finds the word, highlight the entire word  in yellow using a css styling selector
                      Use the object function  indexOf  in the statement   mainParas[i].textContent.indexOf(searchPhrase) >= 0)
                     where mainParams[i] is the ith paragraph element, and searchPhrase is the textcontent of a textbox, or a spantab. Make use of 
                     document.getElementById("id") to extract the data from the textbox.

            B)    Extends the js to count the number of words found and place that result in the textcontent of a heading element.

            C)    Generalizes the application to search for any type of element for the occurrences of the word and then counts the number of occurrences
                   of a word within each of the html types ( inner list, paragraph, outer list)

3) Given the flexible container application on the mid-term exam question7 with the nav, section,paragraph and inner div elements, create a click event for the inner div elements which places
   dynamically image context within the div elements and centers the image., that is, the div section is a flex container, the div element is a flex element, and the div 
   element itself is a flex container which dynamically appends an image. ( see attached output for what is should appear as)
   
   Use the methods in Album.html to associate a div element with a click event that places the image in the flexible div element.
   Modify the css selectors to make each div element flexible with centered content and also establish the size of the image in each div container.



4) Extend the innerconflict method but only for generating nested multicolored square containers ( nested div elements)-No click events for the div elements.
    The   div elements are nested rectangular, but randomly change the colors inside in an animation frame. This can be done by creating 
    10 + new inner nested div containers instead of two. ( Create on the HTML ). Instead of using the nested concept in innerconflict application
    use instead position:absolute in the css page  and don't nest the divs ( list them separately on the HTML page line-by-line).  Each nested div element should look like the additional attached files (Project_Question_4_illustrate,
   Project_Question_4_illustrate_2). Use the element.style.backgroundColor = (i,j,k) as the statement for modifying color, where i,j,k are the rgb components- do
  not use the statement  element.style.backgroundColor = rgb(i,j,k) as rgb will not work with this particular invokation of the html element .

5) Using the methods of the slides #14 for creating user-defined objects, take the application from  question 3  or question 4 (your choice)and convert it into object class-form with a 
    constructor and a method in a js file. For example,for question 3,the constructor should accept the outer flex container ( which will contain the three side by side inner div elements).
    The constructor should also access the array of div elements  and alias a click event via the addEventListener function. The function should be 
    placed in the method portion of the class object.

6) a)Take the application which styled a paragraph listed below and modify it so that additional  css style is given to the enclosing  div section element- make the div section have
    a gray background color and give it a black border. The css should make use of more advanced techniques that we covered in the slides dealing with nested elements
    and offsets within those elements- this was the unsophisticated  preliminary version which simply positioned elements inside the page but not relative to the container
    they were situated in. (Result attached).
    b) Create a js file which  -contains a button click function which accepts text at run time within a textbox element,
    c)  and then replaces the original paragraph
        content with the dynamically defined paragraph content- use   document.getElementById("texta").value     for a textarea input;
    d) Allows the click event to change the background color of the paragraph from blue to light gray  and back again with each button click.
